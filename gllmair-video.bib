Ses atouts ne sont plus à démontrer : installation rapide, interface de gestion simple à utiliser, il s'adapte à tous les types de contenu (blog, site institutionnel, e-commerce, portfolio...). Chaque site créé avec WordPress utilise un thème : créer ou personnaliser un thème vous permet donc de gérer l'affichage de votre site : le design, l'ergonomie et l'apparence de tous les contenus. Ce livre s'adresse à toute personne connaissant déjà WordPress et souhaitant débuter dans la création de nouveaux thèmes ou la personnalisation de thèmes existants. Il a été rédigé à l'aide de la version 4.1 de WordPress. Dans un premier temps, vous apprendrez à gérer les thèmes pour votre site WordPress : rechercher un thème, installer et activer un thème. Vous apprendrez aussi à personnaliser les thèmes dans l'interface standard. Puis, nous aborderons les bases du langage PHP, prérequis nécessaire puisque les thèmes sont créés avec les trois langages « ; fondamentaux » du Web : HTML, CSS et PHP. La connaissance de l'HTML et des CSS est recommandée. Nous verrons ensuite comment sont structurés les thèmes WordPress et quels sont les fichiers qui les composent. Nous apprendrons à utiliser la hiérarchie des templates (les modèles de page) pour connaître les fichiers qui sont utilisés pour tous les types d'affichage : la page d'accueil, les articles, les pages, les archives... Nous créerons alors un premier thème très simple pour mettre en pratique ces premières notions. Dans un deuxième temps, nous vous proposons de créer un thème complet, avec tous les templates nécessaires à l'affichage de tous les types de contenu : la page d'accueil, les articles seuls, les pages, les commentaires et les archives : catégorie, mot-clé, auteur... Ensuite nous aborderons la personnalisation des thèmes avec l'interface standard de WordPress, l'API Customizer. Ainsi, les utilisateurs seront à même de pouvoir modifier eux-mêmes certaines options du thème. Nous terminerons en analysant dans le détail le thème proposé par défaut dans WordPress, TwentyFifteen, afin de bien comprendre son fonctionnement dans le but de l'utiliser comme thème parent pour créer des thèmes enfant.},

  abstract = {Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:SyntaxObjectsFunctionsInheritanceArraysRegular expressionsMethodsStyleBeautiful featuresThe real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.},

Using a downloadable programming environment developed by the author, Visualizing Data demonstrates methods for representing data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more.How do the 3.1 billion A, C, G and T letters of the human genome compare to those of a chimp or a mouse? What do the paths that millions of visitors take through a web site look like? With Visualizing Data, you learn how to answer complex questions like these with thoroughly interactive displays. We're not talking about cookie-cutter charts and graphs. This book teaches you how to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets with the help of a powerful new design and prototyping tool called "Processing".Used by many researchers and companies to convey specific data in a clear and understandable manner, the Processing beta is available free. With this tool and Visualizing Data as a guide, you'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features that will bring users to your site over and over. This book teaches you:The seven stages of visualizing data -- acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interactHow all data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer without extraneous detailsSeveral example projects with the code to make them workPositive and negative points of each representation discussed. The focus is on customization so that each one best suits what you want to convey about your data setThe book does not provide ready-made "visualizations" that can be plugged into any data set. Instead, with chapters divided by types of data rather than types of display, you'll learn how each visualization conveys the unique properties of the data it represents -- why the data was collected, what's interesting about it, and what stories it can tell. Visualizing Data teaches you how to answer questions, not simply display information.},

Although digital media is often positioned in opposition to the “manual” act of drawing, the broader territory of “computing” includes matters of language, rules, procedures, and orders that are very much compatible with the presence of ink on paper. Indeed, the nature of drawing―a temporal medium governed by marks that can be precisely defined, but not easily edited―provides welcome structure for computational methods.},

If you purchased this version, send proof of purchase to janozer@gmail.com and I'll send you a free PDF copy of the update (\$29.95 value). Note that the changes in the book are concentrated, with new sections on Bento4 in Chapters 10 and 12, and several new sections on live transcoding and AV1 encoding in Chapter 14. Otherwise, most of the book is the same, so having a physical copy of the old edition and a PDF of the new should not be a hassle. Note that if you wait and buy a physical copy of the new edition, you won't get a PDF copy. This focused 120-page book teaches readers how to use FFmpeg to create full adaptive bitrate ladders and package them into HLS or DASH formats. The book also includes a primer on terms and technologies related to streaming and recommended settings for all parameters detailed in the book.Initial chapters focus on installing FFmpeg on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers, and basics of command-line programming. Then the technology primer, and individual chapters on bitrate control, resolution, frame rate, I-, B-, P- and reference-frame settings. These are followed by chapters on H.264 and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), which includes instruction on Apple tools Media File Segmenter, Variant Playlist Creator, and Media Stream Validator. Also covered is encoding for DASH with MP4Box. Next up are chapters on encoding HEVC with x265, and producing VP9, with the final chapter covering miscellaneous operations like concatenating multiple files, or computing PSNR with FFmpeg.A downloadable zipped file includes all (Windows) batch files used in the book, which you can easily adapt for your own use, and a detailed Table of Contents and Index will help you find what you need.

  abstract = {Video Encoding by the Numbers teaches you to optimize the quality and efficiency of your streaming video by objectively detailing the impact of critical configuration options with industry-standard quality metrics like PSNR and SSIMplus. This takes the guesswork out of most encoding decisions and allows readers to achieve the optimal quality/data rate tradeoff. Since all videos encode differently, the tests detailed in the book involve eight different videos, including movie footage, animations, talking head footage, a music video, and PowerPoint and Camtasia-based videos. The book walks the reader through quality testing, basic encoding configurations, encoding with H.264, HEVC, and VP9, and and encoding for adaptive streaming. When appropriate, the chapters conclude with a section detailing how to configure the options discussed with FFmpeg, a preferred tool for high-volume video producers, including packaging into HLS and DASH formats (the latter with MP4Box). You'll also learn how to use key Apple HLS creation and checking tools like Media File Segmenter and Variant Playlist Creator. Here's a chapter-by-chapter description. Chapter 1: Technology Fundamentals. Encoding basics like codecs and container formats for newbies, or for a quick refresher for advanced users. Chapter 2: Basic File Parameters. File parameters like data rate, resolution, frame rate, and bits-per-pixel defined at a high level. Chapter 3: Essential Tools. Identifies the tools you'll need to deliver file information that you simply can't live without. Chapter 4: Testing Overview. Covers a range of testing procedures, from choosing a test clip to verifying your encodes before applying the metric. Chapter 5: Working with Moscow University Video Quality Measurement Tool. Chapter 6: Working with SSIMWave Quality of Experience Monitor. Chapter 7: Choosing Data Rate. Now that you know how to use multiple objective benchmarks, you'll apply that knowledge to choose optimal data rates for your files. Chapter 8: Bitrate Control. You'll learn the impact of bitrate control techniques like VBR and CBR on file quality and deliverability. Chapter 9: I-, B-, P-, and Reference Frames. Rules for choosing key frame and B-frame interval, and the number of reference frames. Chapter 10: Encoding H.264. Learn how to configure H.264-specific configuration options like profiles, levels, and entropy encoding, and x264 encoding options like presets and tuning. Chapter 11: Encoding HEVC. Learn where to deploy the HEVC codec, and how to encode with x265, a high-quality, open-source HEVC codec and with the Adobe Media Encoder. Chapter 12: Encoding VP9. Learn where to deploy the VP9 codec, how quality compares with HEVC and H.264, and how to encode VP9 with FFmpeg. Chapter 13: Choosing an ABR Technology. Learn how ABR works, and how to choose between technologies like HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), and others. Chapter 14: Configuring Your Encoding Ladder. Learn how to choose and configure the rungs in your encoding ladder. Chapter 15: Encoding and Packaging ABR Streams. Learn how to use FFmpeg to create your encoding ladder, and create media and master playlists for your HLS streams. You'll also get an extensive look at the Apple tools for HLS creation, Media File Segmenter, Variant Playlist Creator, and Media Stream Validator. For DASH, you'll learn how to use open-source tool MP4Box to create MPD files.  Chapter 16: Per-title Encoding.

  abstract = {The new edition of an introduction to computer programming within the context of the visual arts, using the open-source programming language Processing; thoroughly updated throughout. The visual arts are rapidly changing as media moves into the web, mobile devices, and architecture. When designers and artists learn the basics of writing software, they develop a new form of literacy that enables them to create new media for the present, and to imagine future media that are beyond the capacities of current software tools. This book introduces this new literacy by teaching computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity. Written by Processing's cofounders, the book offers a definitive reference for students and professionals. Tutorial chapters make up the bulk of the book; advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and installation are discussed in interviews with their creators.This second edition has been thoroughly updated. It is the first book to offer in-depth coverage of Processing 2.0 and 3.0, and all examples have been updated for the new syntax. Every chapter has been revised, and new chapters introduce new ways to work with data and geometry. New “synthesis” chapters offer discussion and worked examples of such topics as sketching with code, modularity, and algorithms. New interviews have been added that cover a wider range of projects. “Extension” chapters are now offered online so they can be updated to keep pace with technological developments in such fields as computer vision and electronics.InterviewsSUE.C, Larry Cuba, Mark Hansen, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Jürg Lehni, LettError, Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman, Benjamin Maus, Manfred Mohr, Ash Nehru, Josh On, Bob Sabiston, Jennifer Steinkamp, Jared Tarbell, Steph Thirion, Robert Winter},

This book is a major new release for 2019, covering the latest version of WordPress.Building a beautiful, professional looking WordPress website (or a blog), is no longer the domain of computer geeks.

Inside this book, veteran WordPress expert Andy Williams will start at the very beginning. You'll learn important topics like:  • The two different versions of WordPress. • Website hosting and domain registrars. How to set this up with separate registrar and host, for more security. • How to install WordPress. • An overview of the Dashboard including how to find hidden items. • Cleaning out the stuff that is installed by default. • Finding and installing WordPress themes to instantly change the look and feel of your website. • Plugins. What they are and how you can use them to create magnificent websites. • How to update WordPress, themes and plugins. • Every single Dashboard setting, what they do, and what you should use in the settings of your website. • How to find and use the RSS feeds on your site to help search engines find your content. • The importance of user profiles, and how to assign a "Gravatar" image to your email address. • How to create great navigation systems on your site, with custom menus, internal linking and related post sections. • Enabling and dealing with visitor comments. • Using the media library for images, video and more.• The difference between pages and posts, and a simple way to know which one you should be using for each bit of content you publish on your website.• Effective use of categories and tags.

A blog style page v a more traditional "static" homepage.• Using widgets on your site to add neat features.We'll also cover those vital plugins every site need, including: • Automatically take backups and get them sent to the cloud. • Automatically create important legal pages on your site, like terms and privacy policy. • Creating a contact page so visitors can contact you. • Add a related posts section to the end of every post to keep visitors on site longer. • Setup good SEO practices. • Setup social sharing buttons on your site, so visitors can easily tell their friends about your great web pages.Most people learn better when they can actually see what they are reading about, so one thing this book isn't, is shy about screenshots. There are over 330 of them, showing you exactly what you will see on your screen, and prompting you to take specific actions as you learn and master WordPress.
