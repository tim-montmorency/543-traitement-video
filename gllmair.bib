Ses atouts ne sont plus \`a d\'emontrer : installation rapide, interface de gestion simple \`a utiliser, il s'adapte \`a tous les types de contenu (blog, site institutionnel, e-commerce, portfolio...). Chaque site cr\'e\'e avec WordPress utilise un th\`eme : cr\'eer ou personnaliser un th\`eme vous permet donc de g\'erer l'affichage de votre site : le design, l'ergonomie et l'apparence de tous les contenus. Ce livre s'adresse \`a toute personne connaissant d\'ej\`a WordPress et souhaitant d\'ebuter dans la cr\'eation de nouveaux th\`emes ou la personnalisation de th\`emes existants. Il a \'et\'e r\'edig\'e \`a l'aide de la version 4.1 de WordPress. Dans un premier temps, vous apprendrez \`a g\'erer les th\`emes pour votre site WordPress : rechercher un th\`eme, installer et activer un th\`eme. Vous apprendrez aussi \`a personnaliser les th\`emes dans l'interface standard. Puis, nous aborderons les bases du langage PHP, pr\'erequis n\'ecessaire puisque les th\`emes sont cr\'e\'es avec les trois langages \guillemotleft{} ; fondamentaux \guillemotright{} du Web : HTML, CSS et PHP. La connaissance de l'HTML et des CSS est recommand\'ee. Nous verrons ensuite comment sont structur\'es les th\`emes WordPress et quels sont les fichiers qui les composent. Nous apprendrons \`a utiliser la hi\'erarchie des templates (les mod\`eles de page) pour conna\^itre les fichiers qui sont utilis\'es pour tous les types d'affichage : la page d'accueil, les articles, les pages, les archives... Nous cr\'eerons alors un premier th\`eme tr\`es simple pour mettre en pratique ces premi\`eres notions. Dans un deuxi\`eme temps, nous vous proposons de cr\'eer un th\`eme complet, avec tous les templates n\'ecessaires \`a l'affichage de tous les types de contenu : la page d'accueil, les articles seuls, les pages, les commentaires et les archives : cat\'egorie, mot-cl\'e, auteur... Ensuite nous aborderons la personnalisation des th\`emes avec l'interface standard de WordPress, l'API Customizer. Ainsi, les utilisateurs seront \`a m\^eme de pouvoir modifier eux-m\^emes certaines options du th\`eme. Nous terminerons en analysant dans le d\'etail le th\`eme propos\'e par d\'efaut dans WordPress, TwentyFifteen, afin de bien comprendre son fonctionnement dans le but de l'utiliser comme th\`eme parent pour cr\'eer des th\`emes enfant.},

La connaissance de l'HTML et des CSS est donc recommand\'ee. Nous verrons ensuite comment sont structur\'es les th\`emes WordPress et quels sont les fichiers qui les composent. Nous apprendrons \`a utiliser la hi\'erarchie des templates (les mod\`eles de page) pour conna\^itre les fichiers qui sont utilis\'es pour tous les types d'affichage : la page d'accueil, les articles, les pages, les archives... Un chapitre est enti\`erement consacr\'e \`a l'\'etude des principaux marqueurs de mod\`eles (template tags) qui vont chercher les informations, les donn\'ees et les contenus pour permettre leur affichage dans les templates. Puis nous analyserons dans le d\'etail le th\`eme propos\'e par d\'efaut dans WordPress 4.7, Twenty Seventeen, afin de bien comprendre son fonctionnement, sa structure et son architecture. Vous pourrez ainsi l'utiliser comme th\`eme parent pour cr\'eer des th\`emes enfants. Actuellement la conception de th\`eme WordPress passe principalement par l'utilisation de th\`eme de d\'emarrage (starter theme). Ces th\`emes de d\'emarrage vous proposent une architecture et une structure de fichiers de base ; \`a l'aide de la hi\'erarchie des fichiers et des marqueurs de mod\`eles, vous pourrez ainsi concevoir vos propres th\`emes rapidement. Nous \'etudierons les th\`emes de d\'emarrage JointsWP et Underscores \`a partir duquel nous concevrons un th\`eme personnalis\'e. Nous terminerons par la personnalisation des th\`emes avec l'interface standard de WordPress, l'API Customizer. Ainsi, les utilisateurs seront \`a m\^eme de pouvoir modifier eux-m\^emes certaines options du th\`eme que vous proposerez ; le dernier chapitre est consacr\'e \`a la conception des th\`emes enfants.},

  abstract = {Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole\textemdash a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:SyntaxObjectsFunctionsInheritanceArraysRegular expressionsMethodsStyleBeautiful featuresThe real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

What do the paths that millions of visitors take through a web site look like? With Visualizing Data, you learn how to answer complex questions like these with thoroughly interactive displays. We're not talking about cookie-cutter charts and graphs. This book teaches you how to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets with the help of a powerful new design and prototyping tool called "Processing".Used by many researchers and companies to convey specific data in a clear and understandable manner, the Processing beta is available free. With this tool and Visualizing Data as a guide, you'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features that will bring users to your site over and over. This book teaches you:The seven stages of visualizing data -- acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interactHow all data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer without extraneous detailsSeveral example projects with the code to make them workPositive and negative points of each representation discussed. The focus is on customization so that each one best suits what you want to convey about your data setThe book does not provide ready-made "visualizations" that can be plugged into any data set. Instead, with chapters divided by types of data rather than types of display, you'll learn how each visualization conveys the unique properties of the data it represents -- why the data was collected, what's interesting about it, and what stories it can tell. Visualizing Data teaches you how to answer questions, not simply display information.},

If you purchased this version, send proof of purchase to janozer@gmail.com and I'll send you a free PDF copy of the update (\$29.95 value). Note that the changes in the book are concentrated, with new sections on Bento4 in Chapters 10 and 12, and several new sections on live transcoding and AV1 encoding in Chapter 14. Otherwise, most of the book is the same, so having a physical copy of the old edition and a PDF of the new should not be a hassle. Note that if you wait and buy a physical copy of the new edition, you won't get a PDF copy. This focused 120-page book teaches readers how to use FFmpeg to create full adaptive bitrate ladders and package them into HLS or DASH formats. The book also includes a primer on terms and technologies related to streaming and recommended settings for all parameters detailed in the book.Initial chapters focus on installing FFmpeg on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers, and basics of command-line programming. Then the technology primer, and individual chapters on bitrate control, resolution, frame rate, I-, B-, P- and reference-frame settings. These are followed by chapters on H.264 and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), which includes instruction on Apple tools Media File Segmenter, Variant Playlist Creator, and Media Stream Validator. Also covered is encoding for DASH with MP4Box. Next up are chapters on encoding HEVC with x265, and producing VP9, with the final chapter covering miscellaneous operations like concatenating multiple files, or computing PSNR with FFmpeg.A downloadable zipped file includes all (Windows) batch files used in the book, which you can easily adapt for your own use, and a detailed Table of Contents and Index will help you find what you need.

  abstract = {Video Encoding by the Numbers teaches you to optimize the quality and efficiency of your streaming video by objectively detailing the impact of critical configuration options with industry-standard quality metrics like PSNR and SSIMplus. This takes the guesswork out of most encoding decisions and allows readers to achieve the optimal quality/data rate tradeoff. Since all videos encode differently, the tests detailed in the book involve eight different videos, including movie footage, animations, talking head footage, a music video, and PowerPoint and Camtasia-based videos. The book walks the reader through quality testing, basic encoding configurations, encoding with H.264, HEVC, and VP9, and and encoding for adaptive streaming. When appropriate, the chapters conclude with a section detailing how to configure the options discussed with FFmpeg, a preferred tool for high-volume video producers, including packaging into HLS and DASH formats (the latter with MP4Box). You'll also learn how to use key Apple HLS creation and checking tools like Media File Segmenter and Variant Playlist Creator. Here's a chapter-by-chapter description. Chapter 1: Technology Fundamentals. Encoding basics like codecs and container formats for newbies, or for a quick refresher for advanced users. Chapter 2: Basic File Parameters. File parameters like data rate, resolution, frame rate, and bits-per-pixel defined at a high level. Chapter 3: Essential Tools. Identifies the tools you'll need to deliver file information that you simply can't live without. Chapter 4: Testing Overview. Covers a range of testing procedures, from choosing a test clip to verifying your encodes before applying the metric. Chapter 5: Working with Moscow University Video Quality Measurement Tool. Chapter 6: Working with SSIMWave Quality of Experience Monitor. Chapter 7: Choosing Data Rate. Now that you know how to use multiple objective benchmarks, you'll apply that knowledge to choose optimal data rates for your files. Chapter 8: Bitrate Control. You'll learn the impact of bitrate control techniques like VBR and CBR on file quality and deliverability. Chapter 9: I-, B-, P-, and Reference Frames. Rules for choosing key frame and B-frame interval, and the number of reference frames. Chapter 10: Encoding H.264. Learn how to configure H.264-specific configuration options like profiles, levels, and entropy encoding, and x264 encoding options like presets and tuning. Chapter 11: Encoding HEVC. Learn where to deploy the HEVC codec, and how to encode with x265, a high-quality, open-source HEVC codec and with the Adobe Media Encoder. Chapter 12: Encoding VP9. Learn where to deploy the VP9 codec, how quality compares with HEVC and H.264, and how to encode VP9 with FFmpeg. Chapter 13: Choosing an ABR Technology. Learn how ABR works, and how to choose between technologies like HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), and others. Chapter 14: Configuring Your Encoding Ladder. Learn how to choose and configure the rungs in your encoding ladder. Chapter 15: Encoding and Packaging ABR Streams. Learn how to use FFmpeg to create your encoding ladder, and create media and master playlists for your HLS streams. You'll also get an extensive look at the Apple tools for HLS creation, Media File Segmenter, Variant Playlist Creator, and Media Stream Validator.

  abstract = {The new edition of an introduction to computer programming within the context of the visual arts, using the open-source programming language Processing; thoroughly updated throughout. The visual arts are rapidly changing as media moves into the web, mobile devices, and architecture. When designers and artists learn the basics of writing software, they develop a new form of literacy that enables them to create new media for the present, and to imagine future media that are beyond the capacities of current software tools. This book introduces this new literacy by teaching computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity. Written by Processing's cofounders, the book offers a definitive reference for students and professionals. Tutorial chapters make up the bulk of the book; advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and installation are discussed in interviews with their creators.This second edition has been thoroughly updated. It is the first book to offer in-depth coverage of Processing 2.0 and 3.0, and all examples have been updated for the new syntax. Every chapter has been revised, and new chapters introduce new ways to work with data and geometry. New ``synthesis'' chapters offer discussion and worked examples of such topics as sketching with code, modularity, and algorithms. New interviews have been added that cover a wider range of projects. ``Extension'' chapters are now offered online so they can be updated to keep pace with technological developments in such fields as computer vision and electronics.InterviewsSUE.C, Larry Cuba, Mark Hansen, Lynn Hershman Leeson, J\"urg Lehni, LettError, Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman, Benjamin Maus, Manfred Mohr, Ash Nehru, Josh On, Bob Sabiston, Jennifer Steinkamp, Jared Tarbell, Steph Thirion, Robert Winter},

For more than 30 years, it's been locked in a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The fight between the two countries began in the early 20th century but became a frozen conflict for 60 years while the whole region was under the control of the Soviet Union.  When the Soviet Union fell, newfound independence sparked a brutal six-year war in the region, where Armenia emerged victorious. From 1994 to 2020, Armenia controlled Nagorno-Karabakh, while Azerbaijan rebuilt its military. Fighting erupted again in summer 2020, and Azerbaijan went on the offensive \textemdash\&nbsp;eventually capturing most of Nagorno-Karabakh and dramatically reshaping the region.
